<p> You are so special to me and you are alot prettier than you think, you have beautiful eyes </p>
<p> which i love staring into. I dont understand how you can hate how you look because you are </p>
<p> so pretty, i can't help but admire you every time i see you and you make me so happy every </p>
<p> time i do. I love calling you on a night, it makes me look forward to falling asleep since </p>
<p> i get to talk to you before and you make me smile and i know i would be no where near </p>
<p> as happy as i am now if we never started talking. I can't wait to give you a hug and make you </p>
<p> blush because i bet you will look even cuter than normal. I actually do like you alot and i </p>
<p> hope u can see that. I hope that i can keep making you happy and that one day maybe we can </p>
<p> do more, but until then im happy with what we have now xx </p>
