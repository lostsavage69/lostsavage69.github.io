<p> You are so special to me and you are alot prettier than you think, you have beautiful eyes which i love staring into. </p>
<p> I dont understand how you can hate how you look because you are so pretty, i can't help but admire you every time </p>
<p> i see you and you make me so happy every time i do. I love calling you on a night, it makes me look forward to falling </p>
<p> asleep since i get to talk to you before an you make me smile and laugh, i might bully you a little but you mean so </p>
<p> to me and i know i would be no where near as happy as i am now if we never started talking. I can't wait to give you </p>
<p> a hug and make you blush because i bet you will look even cuter than normal. I actually do like you alot and i hope u </p>
<p> can see that. I hope that i can keep making you happy and that one day maybe we can do more, but until then im happy </p>
<p> with what we have now xx </p>
